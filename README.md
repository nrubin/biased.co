=========

Side-by-side Jerusalem Post and Al Jazeera Reader, powered by the Readability API.

Consider it an exploration into how biases manifest. A third publication was planned but isn't selected because a third publication would make it seem like there's a truth, which when it comes to the situation in the middle east there isn't.

This is more art project than product, so don't expect much :)
